# Snapchat Ads Integration

Grant Second Stage access to Snapchat Business Manager and the Snap Pixel so TRACKS can read campaign performance and pixel-level events.

### Invite the Second Stage user

In Snapchat Business Manager, go to **Business Settings → Members** and invite `analytics@secondstage.io` with **Ad Account Analyst** access. This grants the permissions TRACKS needs to view campaign, ad squad, and ad performance, export reports, access attribution data in reporting, and use the API reporting endpoints.
