# TRACKS Attribution Measurement API

## Overview

The Measurement API tracks the customer acquisition source, enabling you to identify which channels, campaigns, ads drive install and other in-game events. By integrating with TRACKS Attribution, you can accurately attribute conversions to the correct media sources, helping you optimize your marketing efforts.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure the following:

- A Google Cloud Platform account with billing enabled (Google Cloud Platform microservices will auto-scale as needed for your game).
- Access to Measurement API credentials (API key and secret).
- A TRACKS account with the attribution package enabled and ready for integration.
- Basic knowledge of server-side programming, cloud services, and API integrations.
- A telemetry server capable of reading and collecting client IPs via HTTP headers or X-Forwarded-For (XFF).
- A webhook, postback, or proxy mechanism that can trigger real-time Measurement API requests or perform batch uploads via cron jobs.

To integrate with TRACKS Attribution, you'll need to create and implement a lightweight server-side HTTP request as a webhook on your backend. The Measurement API is the only supported method for this integration. You can view a pseudo-code example for constructing the API request below.

The webhook should trigger every time a game open (session start) event is logged in your telemetry system.

The Measurement API Endpoint requires the following parameters:

- IP address
- User ID
- Event timestamp
- Platform
- Storefront

    ```

For each game added, the Second Stage Analytics team provides comprehensive support for integration, deployment, and testing, starting with an onboarding call.

## API Endpoints Setup

To track media channel acquisition sources, you need to implement the API endpoint that records acquisition events.
    
=== "API endpoint `collect`"

    *API Endpoint:* `/collect`

    *Description:* This endpoint records web events, capturing details about the acquisition source.

    *Method:* `POST`

    *Endpoint URL:* `https://tracks.yourgame.com/v1/collect`

    *Headers:*
    `Authorization:` Bearer `<API_KEY>`
    `Content-Type: application/json`

    Here is an example of source code for your reference:

    ```
        # Example Python Code for web client-side
        import config
        import requests
    
    
        def track_acquisition(data):
           headers = {
               'Authorization': f'Bearer {config.API_KEY}',
               'Content-Type': 'application/json'
           }
           try:
               response = requests.post(f"{https://tracks.yourgame.com/v1/collect", json=data, headers=headers)
               response.raise_for_status()
               print('Acquisition event recorded:', response.json())
           except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as err:
               print('Error recording acquisition event:', err.response.json())
    
    
        acquisition_data = {
           "event_name": "web_visit",
           "timestamp": "2024-08-29T12:00:00Z",
           "channel": "paid_search",
           "campaign": "summer_sale",
           "source": "google",
           "medium": "cpc",
           "term": "steamsale",
           "content": "ad_1",
           "clientId": "12345",
           "sessionId": "abcdef123456",
           "ip": "175.124.248.15",
           "device": "mobile",
           "browser": "chrome"
        }
    
    
        track_acquisition(acquisition_data)
    ```

=== "API Endpoint `measure`"
    
    *API Endpoint:* `/measure`

    *Description:* This endpoint records web events, capturing details about the acquisition source.

    *Method:* `POST`

    *Endpoint URL:* `https://tracks.yourgame.com/v1/measure`

    *Headers:*
    `Authorization:` Bearer `<API_KEY>`
    `Content-Type: application/json`

    Here is an example of source code for your reference:
    ```
        # Example Python Code for server-side telemetry
        import requests
    
        url = "https://tracks.yourgame.com/v1/measure" 
    
        payload = {
         'user_id': '1a23fd44c21f8l5r',
         'event_name': 'game_open',
         'ip': '175.124.248.15',
         'timestamp': '2024-08-29T12:00:00Z',
         'platform': 'pc',
         'storefront': 'steam'
        }
        headers = {
          'Authorization': f'Bearer {config.API_KEY}',
        }
        response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload)
        print(response.text)
    ```

## Test Environment 

**Test the Integration:**

- Click on a UTM-tagged test link and open the game for the first time.
- Ensure your server is running and correctly configured to handle HTTP requests.
- Trigger acquisition events manually or through your application to test the integration.
- Check Cloud Run logging to confirm that the endpoint logs show no errors.
- Verify on the attribution tool dashboard that acquisition events are tracked accurately.
- Ensure that the data (channels, campaigns, sources) aligns with your expectations.
  
**Troubleshooting:**

- Invalid Credentials: Confirm that your API key and secret are correct and have the necessary permissions.
- Network Errors: Review your serverâ€™s network configuration and API base URL.
- Data Mismatches: Ensure the event payload matches the required schema and that timestamp formats are correct.

!!! tip "Consent Recommendation"
    It is recommended to include an in-game consent dialog if this is not already part of your flow. Collecting user consent is a GDPR best practice and helps ensure transparency.  

    - If consent is granted, the `user_id` may be salt-hashed.  
    - If consent is declined, the `user_id` should be irreversibly anonymized.
